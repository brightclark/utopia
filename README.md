# ![Utopia Logo](materials/utopia.svg)

Utopia is a website generation framework which provides a robust set of tools to build highly complex dynamic websites. It uses the filesystem heavily for content and provides functions for interacting with files and directories as structure representing the website.

## Motivation

The [original Utopia project](https://github.com/ioquatix/utopia-php) was written in PHP in the early 2000s. It consisted of an XML parser, a database layer and some code to assist with business logic. It was initially designed to reduce the amount of HTML required to build both content-centric websites and business apps. At the time, CSS was very poorly supported and thus a lot of the time, you'd be using quite complex `<table>`s with embedded `<img>`s to generate simple things like boxes with drop shadows, etc. Utopia provided a core concept - a node - which was essentially a small snippet of HTML, which could be composed into other nodes simply by using a named tag (similar to ColdFusion). Attributes and content were passed in, and thus you could easily build complex pages with simple semantic markup.

At the time, the available frameworks were pretty basic. Utopia was a working, albeit poor, implementation of MVC and supported several commercial websites I developed at the time. I made it, partly just because I could, but also because it served a commercial purpose.

Eventually one day I started using Ruby on Rails. There are aspects of the Rails framework which I like. However, at the time I was using it (starting with version 0.8), I found that it's flat organisation of controllers and views very limiting. Nested controllers and views make it easier to manage complexity in a web application. Utopia embraces this principle, and applies it to both the controller and view layers. I also developed a [model layer with similar principles](https://github.com/ioquatix/relaxo-model).

So, Utopia exists because it suits my way of thinking about web applications, and it's conceptual core has been refined for over a decade. It provides a considered amount of both flexibility, and opinionated behavior.

### Is it production ready?

Yes. We've used Utopia since about 2010 in production.

### Is it fast?

Yes. [Trenni](https://github.com/ioquatix/trenni) includes native [Ragel](http://www.colm.net/open-source/ragel/) parsers, and Utopia uses [Concurrent::Map](https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby) for multi-thread safe caches. On my laptop, Utopia can process 3000 requests/s rendering content on a single thread.

## Installation

Make sure you have git, ruby, and bundler installed and set up correctly.

Install utopia:

	$ gem install utopia

Create a new site:

	$ mkdir www.example.com
	$ cd www.example.com
	$ utopia site create
	$ rake
